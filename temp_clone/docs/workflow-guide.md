# 4MK Status Workflow - Plain English Guide

## 📋 **How the Help Request Process Works**

### **Step 1: Need is Posted** 
- **Status: 🔵 SEEKING HELP** 
- Someone posts a need for help
- Others can see it and offer to help
- Multiple people can make offers

### **Step 2: Helper Makes Offer**
- Helper clicks "I Can Help With This" 
- Chooses offer type (General, Digital Service, Store Pickup, Service Booking)
- Provides details about how they'll help
- **Offer Status: Proposed** (waiting for response)

### **Step 3: Requester Reviews Offers**
- Requester gets email notification about new offer
- Logs into 4MK to see all offers
- Can **Accept** or **Decline** each offer
- Only ONE offer can be accepted per need

### **Step 4: Offer is Accepted**
- **Need Status: 🟡 HELP IN PROGRESS**
- **Offer Status: Accepted**
- Helper gets acceptance email
- Helper and requester coordinate via email to share:
  - Pickup codes (for digital services)
  - Store locations and confirmation numbers
  - Appointment details and booking confirmations

### **Step 5: Help is Completed**
- Helper provides the promised help
- Requester receives what they needed
- Requester clicks "Mark Complete" in 4MK
- **Need Status: 🟢 COMPLETED**
- **Offer Status: Fulfilled**
- Helper gets completion confirmation email
